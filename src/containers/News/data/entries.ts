      'Welcome to my portfolio!  I am a Front End Engineer that specializes in React and TypeScript applications, but am always open to learn the hottest new framework.  Eager and dedicated, I am always looking to gain a new skill, expand my knowledge, or pioneer a new technology.  In my time as a developer, I have set myself apart from my peers with a propensity to write exceedingly well architected and clean, readable code.  I am always pushing for increased standardization across my whole team: more testing; more linting; stricter pull request criteria; and a sensible project structure.  I take great pride in my work, plagued by a near borderline obsession with properly maintaining and documenting my repos to prevent the monstrous buildup of tech-debt that I have witnessed countless developers before me contribute to.  While I am highly skilled in a product-driven development environment with clear goals and provided UI/UX like Agile, I truly shine when given the creative freedom to toss out ideas, give push-back when necessary, optimize UI/UX, and rapidly develop and prototype new applications.  I was even given the honor of being pulled from my current team to be the sole front-end developer on an urgent project, reporting directly to the Chief Technology Officer; tasked with rapidly building\nproof of concepts and prototypes to aid the business in the development of a new revenue stream to revitalize lead generation in a\npost-COVID19 world.  If you\'re a recruiter and like what you see here, or you\'re another developer and want to connect, shoot me an <a href="mailto: poole.tyler.b@gmail.com">email</a>.',
